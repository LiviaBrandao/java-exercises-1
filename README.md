Some exercises to practice logical thinking and also refresh some concepts.

## Exercise I - Array Subsets

Given an integer array, divide the array into 2 subsets A and B while respecting the following conditions:
• The intersection of A and B is null.

• The union A and B is equal to the original array.

• The number of elements in subset A is minimal.

• The sum of A's elements is greater than the sum of B's elements.

Return the subset A in increasing order where the sum of A's elements is greater than the sum of B's elements. If more
than one subset exists, return the one with the maximal sum.

## Exercise II - Binary Number in a Linked List

Binary Number in a Linked List A binary number is a series of O's and 1's. Consider the series as a singly-linked list.
Given a reference to the head of a singly- linked list, convert the binary number represented to a decimal number.
Example:
